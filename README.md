cassandra-driver-mapping
========================
  
Entity Mapper Add-on for the [DataStax Java Driver (Driver)](http://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.3/index.html) for [Cassandra (C*)](http://cassandra.apache.org/).  
This Add-on allows you to synchronize schema automatically and persist JPA annotated entities in Cassandra.

No mapping files, no scripts, no configuration files.  
No need to create Tables and Indexes for your Entity manually.  
Entity definition will be automatically synchronized with Cassandra.

Add-on is not replacement for the Driver but lightweight Object Mapper on top of it.  
You still can utilize full power of the Driver API and Datastax documentation.     
Mapping Add-on relies on JPA 2.1 and Driver 3+
